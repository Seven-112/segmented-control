## Getting started

Install the library using either Yarn:

```
yarn add @react-native-community/segmented-control
```

or npm:

```
npm install --save @react-native-community/segmented-control
```

## Link

- React Native 0.60+

run `cd ios && pod install`

- React Native <= 0.59

run `react-native link @react-native-community/segmented-control`

or you can follow the instructions to [manually link this package](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios#manual-linking).

## Upgrading to React Native _0.60+_

New React Native comes with `autolinking` feature, which automatically links Native Modules in your project. In order to get it to work, make sure you unlink `Segmented Control` first:

`react-native unlink @react-native-community/segmented-control`

## Migrating from the core `react-native` module

This module was created when the segmentedControlIos was split out from the core of React Native. To migrate to this module you need to follow the installation instructions above and then change you imports from:

```javascript
import {SegmentedControlIOS} from 'react-native';
```

to:

```javascript
import SegmentedControlIOS from '@react-native-community/segmented-control';
```

## Usage

Start by importing the library:

Use `SegmentedControlIOS` to render a UISegmentedControl iOS.

#### Programmatically changing selected index

The selected index can be changed on the fly by assigning the
selectedIndex prop to a state variable, then changing that variable.
Note that the state variable would need to be updated as the user
selects a value and changes the index, as shown in the example below.

```javascript
import SegmentedControlIOS from '@react-native-community/segmented-control';

return (
  <SegmentedControlIOS
    values={['One', 'Two']}
    selectedIndex={this.state.selectedIndex}
    onChange={(event) => {
      this.setState({selectedIndex: event.nativeEvent.selectedSegmentIndex});
    }}
  />
);
```
